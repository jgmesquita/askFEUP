# askFEUP

## Project vision

askFEUP aims to create a collaborative online platform where FEUP students can ask questions, share experiences, and connect on academic and social topics. Our goal is to build a user-friendly, mobile-responsive space where students can seek advice, offer help, and engage with peers in a supportive community.

The platform will feature categorized questions, personalized content via a "For You" page, and interactive tools like upvoting and leaderboards to encourage participation. With clear roles for administrators, moderators, and users, askFEUP will foster a respectful, well-moderated environment, becoming a central hub for student engagement and collaboration.
